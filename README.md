# Real-time-clock-with-alarm-function-temperature-and-humidity-measurement

This Project was made using the Runtime library. This library is intended exclusively for use in the context of teaching. Any other use, especially of a commercial nature, is prohibited.

this project implements a real-time clock with an alarm function and a temperature and humidity display. Settings are conveniently made using a rotary encoder; the QuadEncoder module is available for this.
For temperature and humidity measurement, there are an analogue sensors that are connected via A/D converters. Both sensors supply voltage values that are proportional to the measured physical quantity. They can be assumed to be linear.
